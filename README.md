# Fraud_Detection_Erdos_Deep_Learning
We apply unsupervised deep learning algorithms to fraud detection for the kaggle IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset
## Background
What separates fraud detection from other deep learning applications is that it is close to impossible for human beings to tell if a transaction is fraudulent just by looking at transaction data. This is not true in image classification, for example, where it is possible for humans to tell if the image is of a cat or a dog. In the absence of such human-generated benchmarks, we need to rely solely on machines to learn hidden patterns in the data, which would be invisible to the human eye.

## Problem Statement
Primary goal is for the deep learning model to outperform other more traditional unsupervised methods (clustering algorithms etc.). Preexisting models that incorporate these data sets mostly rely on supervised learning methods, so we'll implement traditional clustering algorithms to establish a baseline performance. Our goal is to build a model that outperforms the baseline in both precision and recall. 

## Objectives

-create a Gaussian baseline model
-create a deep learning model with 
-outperformed baseline model in precision, recall, and AUC-ROC
## KPIs
-precision
-recall
-AUC-ROC
-F1-score
## Stakeholders
We see this project being used by commercial banking and financial institutions to detect fraudulent transactions. We aim to provide an improvement from existing models.
